# 实用语句
- 创建库 
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE test
    ```
- 创建表
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `hello_user`(
    `user_id` INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `user_name` VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    `phone` VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    `create_date` DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY ( `user_id` )
    )ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
    ```
- 删除表中重复数据
    ```sql
    DELETE
    FROM health_disease_info WHERE 
    disease_name IN (
    select * from (
        SELECT disease_name FROM health_disease_info GROUP BY disease_name HAVING count(disease_name) > 1
    ) as tmp
    )
    AND disease_id NOT IN(
    select * from (
        select min(disease_id) from health_disease_info group by disease_name HAVING count(disease_name) > 1
    ) as tmp
    )
    ```
